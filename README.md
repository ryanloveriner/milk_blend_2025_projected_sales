This project for Iconik Coffee Roasters uses historical sales data to create a simple forecasting model that predicts the retail sales of our new Milk Blend.

Check out the results [here](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/milk_blend_2025_projected_sales/blob/main/2025-Milk-Blend-Projections_public.pdf), while noting that the data itself has been redacted for privacy.

You can see the R code used to produce the Rmarkdown file [here](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/milk_blend_2025_projected_sales/blob/main/2025%20Milk%20Blend%20Projections.Rmd).
